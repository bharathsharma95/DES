# DES
A simple crypto system being implemented in python, to encrypt a file of any type

## Contents

### DES.py

This would be the root file that does it all

### readFile.py
This script takes in a file as input and reads the file in itself
as bytes and stores it in a list which is returned to the root file

### encrypt.py
As the name suggests, takes in two files, input.txt and key.txt
performs the DES encryption on it, spits out a list of bytes

### decrypt.py (pending)
Coming Soon...


### wFile.py (pending)
Should have the functionality of writing the encrypted and decrypted file
translated from DES.py to wFile.py soon...

### input.txt
is just a file with random alphanumerics

### key.txt
again, is just a file with random alphanumerics

### README.md
Is what you're looking at right now !?
